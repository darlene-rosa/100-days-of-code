# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 47: October 25th, 2022

**Progress**:
- Continued working on my freecodecamp magazine mini-project and worked through a few more lessons in CSS on my UDACITY program

**&Thoughts**:
- I'm seeing the importance of getting the actual reps in everyday with coding in addition to practical learning so I'm glad I decided to do both at once
- In regards to the long awaited tech training program acceptance that I received last week...because it's a multi-step/multi-acceptance long process, I'm going to be okay whether I got full acceptance into the program or not. I say this because I have slight anxiety about the mandatory workshop in two days since my JavaScript skills are not developed enough to do any coding challenges.
- The Udacity acceptance gave me more hope for my futureFull Stack Web Developer career. Things are going to turn out okay because I will not give up :)

### Day 46: October 24th, 2022

**Progress**:
- started a new mini project on freecodecamp and more work on the nanodegree

**&Thoughts**:
- I definitely put a lot of hours into my learning today. I think I may need to jump ahead and get some more practice and familiarity with JavaScript within the next couple of days in preparation for the group workshop. So I may jump between projects, it's not my preferred way of doing things but it's important. 
- my body is definitely starting to feel the fatigue in my body from being on the computer a lot. I need a break. I'm almost half way through the hundred day challenge and this is where it's starting to get a bit more challenging.

### Day 45: October 23rd, 2022

**Progress**:

**&Thoughts**:
- I learned so much using Udacity's learning program. I like their structure and I'm super grateful I got accepted into the program. I believe it's going to prepare me well for a software developer career. I'm excited that Python, JavaScript, and Java are all included in the curriculum. Now I have a one-stop stop to learn everything that has been on my list to increase my skills.

### Day 44: October 22th, 2022

**Progress**:
- Finished the City Skyline project - [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]. 

**&Thoughts**:
- I learned a lot more about CSS gradients and adding different backgrounds determined by the media size. I liked this project! Complex but satisfying to see the completed work.

### Day 43: October 21th, 2022

**Progress**:
- Working on the City Skyline project - [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]. 
- Got an unexpected SECOND acceptance this week into a tech training program! I'm super excited because it's sponsored by a major tech learning platform Udacity and an IT program, a full scholarship, self-paced and I can start this one right away! I'll be learning HTML, CSS, and Java. 

**&Thoughts**:
- I'm grateful and motivated!

### Day 42: October 20th, 2022

**Progress**:
- Working City Skyline project - [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]. 

**&Thoughts**:
- It was one of those days where my personal life was so busy that I didn't have a lot of time (at least 30 min-1 hr) for coding but I did code several times throughout the day even if broken up into a few minutes at a time. 
- i'm becoming a faster typer but I notice my body gets more restless being on the computer for too long
- looking forward to another day tomorrow!

### Day 41: October 19th, 2022

**Progress**:
- Started the City Skyline project - [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]. 

**&Thoughts**:
- have so much to do today so I did the minimal amount of coding to meet my requirement for this journey. (30 minutes)
- I'm excited to complete this one though. I know it'll take me a few days because it has over 100 steps!

### Day 40: October 18th, 2022

**Progress**:
- Completed the technical documentation page and passed the tests - [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]. 

**&Thoughts**:
- I got an acceptance into the next step of the tech program I applied to! This is more motivation to practice JavaScript sooner.
- I still want to complete the CSS component of the tech doc page

### Day 39: October 17th, 2022

**Progress**:
- Started building a technical documentation page. - [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]. 

**&Thoughts**:
- figured out most of the HTML on my own but CSS is still something I can't do without extra study resources.
- super exhausted today. Did code for  more than an hour. win......

### Day 38: October 16th, 2022

**Progress**:
- Started and finished the Piano project. - [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]. 

**&Thoughts**:
- Piano is actually my favorite instrument. I enjoyed working on this and I think I'm getting at least 1% better in understanding HTML and CSS. Now feeling kind of ready to complete this responsive web design certification to dive back into learning JavaScript! :)

### Day 37: October 15th, 2022

**Progress**:
- Completed the Painting project. - [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]. 

**&Thoughts**:
- to me it looks nothing like a Picasso but I get the concept! #Abstract Art. This project was pretty comprehensive and complicated to be honest. I have a lot to learn about CSS selectors.

**Links**:
https://twitter.com/darlene__rosa/status/1581483932993716224


### Day 36: October 14th, 2022

**Progress**:
- Still working on the Picasso Painting project. 67% completed! - [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]. 

**&Thoughts**:
- I said this in my tweet but I never would have thought I could recreate a painting using CSS. As you learn more, you imagine more. Even if I knew I could create a digital rendition of a painting using CSS, I probably would've chosen a Monet :-)   Just kidding because this Picasso painting is already very complicated. So many steps!

### Day 32 & 33: October 10 - 11th,2022

**Progress**:
- Making progress on "Learn More About CSS Pseudo Selectors By Building a Balance Sheet" Project - [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]. 

**&Thoughts**:
- I guess I forgot to post here too! I was so tired yesterday from my day that I didn't get into coding until way late in the evening. I worked on the balance sheet yesterday and today and finished the majority of the HTML portion.
- I'm starting to add more comments to my code especially CSS since I'm still learning it. This is a practice I used to do for school but I think it'll be good to maintain this practice going forward!

### Day 31: October 9th,2022

**Progress**:
- Started "Learn More About CSS Pseudo Selectors By Building a Balance Sheet" Project - [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]. 

**&Thoughts**:
- Coding session wasn't focused today; sort of sporadic but I think I did at least 30 minutes

**Links**:
https://twitter.com/darlene__rosa/status/1579263664103620608

### Day 29-30: October 7-8th,2022

**Progress**:
- Started and completed the Tribute Page project! [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]. 

**&Thoughts**:
- I'm most proud of myself for staying committed to this journey so far! I've completed mini projects that I once thought were too complicated for me. This is only the beginning of my journey. I made the right choice in diving into HTML & CSS to boost my confidence before delving into the more challenging stuff. Feeling super grateful for all that I've accomplished so far :)

### Day 28: October 6th,2022

**Progress**:
- FINALLY finished the "Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz" mini-project [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]. 

**&Thoughts**:
- Happy to be done with that mini-project. Once I complete all of the projects to acquire the certification, I'll post about it on LinkedIn and perhaps revisit JavaScript or Python. That'll likely be in a few weeks!

**Links**:
https://twitter.com/darlene__rosa/status/1578148104318070784

### Day 27: October 5th,2022

**Progress**:
- 10 more steps of "Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz" mini-project [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]. 40 steps completed.

**&Thoughts**:
- This isn't my personal blog so I can't get very personal but today was a bit of a rough day emotionally. I didn't start coding until very late at night which if you check previous entries, I'm much better when I code in the morning. Don't get me wrong, I can definitely zone in and focus during late night sessions but I highly value my health and I know I should be sleeping. I'm still trying to get into a rhythm with this. Nonetheless, I could not let a day pass where I didn't put my minimum 30 minutes in. Everyday I am fighting for the future I want to create.
- As the projects get progressively more challenging, the freeCodeCamp prompts ask me to complete tasks without so much as reminders or tips of how things are done. I think this is a flaw in the way their projects are structured. I'm having to do an internet search to figure out how to do certain things in HTML when I believe the resource I'm using should be teaching me so that I won't have to go outside of it to figure it out... That's all I have for today!

### Day 25 & 26: October 3rd-4th,2022

**Progress**:
- Forgot to log yesterday! Between yesterday & today, I've completed 30 steps of "Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz" mini-project [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]

**&Thoughts**:
- This quiz is more challenging than it looks. My mind has been distracted with thoughts of my future today so I haven't been able to focus on coding for more than 10-15 minutes at a time. I've done my best for today.

### Day 23: October 1, 2022

**Progress**:
- Completed an additional 20 steps of the "Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label" mini-project [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]

**&Thoughts**:
- Side note: I worked on a new version of my resume for an entry level data analyst or web dev position. Started researching freelance opportunities to increase my skill set. Nothing solid yet! I have no option but to have faith and believe everything will work out BETTER than I can imagine with my career in tech. It's not clear to me yet but Iknow there is something to this for me, I know there are ideal opportunities for me, I know I'll create my path in this field. I b-e-l-i-e-v-e!

### Day 22: September 30, 2022

**Progress**:
- Started the "Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label" mini-project [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]

**&Thoughts**:
- Last day of September! I feel like I've begun my own Fall semester with this self-learning journey. I am super proud of my consistency. They say it takes 21 days to form a habit, well I can say coding daily is now a habit! 3 weeks of consistency feels great. I'm looking forward to being more confident in my skillset.

### Day 20: September 28, 2022

**Progress**:
- Completed the "Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothkp Painting" mini-project [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]

**&Thoughts**:
- This was a fun project to build. Much easier than building the colored markers! I like CSS! It's intuitive but also has many different facets for creating visuals.

### Day 19: September 27, 2022

**Progress**:
- Completed the CSS for the "Build a Survey Form" [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]
- Coded for 2 hours early this morning!

**&Thoughts**:
- I followed a YouTube tutorial to code the CSS portion of the survey form. I've been completing projects in my editor so I haven't seen the live changes. I felt more competent in CSS after watching someone else's thought process in coding and seeing immediate changes.

### Day 18: September 26, 2022

**Progress**:
- Completed the "Build a Survey Form" [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]
- Coded for an hour or more today

**&Thoughts**:
- I'm proud I was able to complete that survey form! I styled after the registration form I did yesterday. My code didn't past the tests right away. Always double check your work for typos! I had to google some details on grouping radio buttons by giving them all the name "name" to pass the tests so only one option could be selected. I had also forgotton to give each checkbox a value of the name of the selection. Still not 100% sure when to use fieldset div select and their distinction with forms. Stuff to learn! Going to practice styling the form

### Day 17: September 25, 2022

**Progress**:
- Completed the "build a registration form" [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]

**&Thoughts**:
- Really liking the mini projects on freeCodeCamp. Happy that this project is done. Content with my progress and my learning! Feeling more confident overall with my consistency and discipline with this 100-day challenge. Hopeful about the future!

### Day 16: September 24, 2022

**Progress**:
- More progress on the "build a registration form" [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]

**&Thoughts**:
- It's late. Almost forgot to post this log...Long day working on other projects. Not many thoughts right now!

### Day 15: September 23, 2022

**Progress**:
- Started the HTML/CSS project "build a registration form" [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]

**&Thoughts**:
- Enjoying the practice I'm getting in building my skills with HTML & CSS. 
- I'm starting to understand more clearly how the front-end works and I'm wondering what kind of projects and daily work I'd do if I did front-end development for a company. One of my goals is to be able to offer a full package service to clients --- beautiful web design and taking care of the backend too. I know some Python, I have to learn JavaScript, and I have to comprehend SQL. More research to do but I am loving the learning process
- I'm proud of myself for making it this far!

### Day 14: September 22, 2022

**Progress**:
- Finished "Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers" [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]

**&Thoughts**:
-  Learning about the numerous ways to create colors with CSS was new to me. I don't recall going this in depth with CSS in my web design course that I took 2 years ago. There's still a lot to learn! 
-  The minimum daily coding time that I set for this challenge is 30 minutes. This past week I've been able to dedicate a lot more time to coding which is great! I think it's because it's generally the first activity I do each day but also, the HTML and CSS projects are keeping me engaged where I want to keep going.
-  I'm still glad I started this challenge! Spending some time coding everyday is becoming second nature to me. I'm so glad I'm getting consistent practice and sticking with it. I'm crushing it with my other two goals of movement and business too! & it's because I took on this challenge first.
-  I'm looking forward to starting the next HTML project tomorrow.

### Day 13: September 21, 2022

**Progress**:
- Spent over an hour coding today! 
- Started the "Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers" [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]

**&Thoughts**:
- It was interesting to learn about 3 different ways to create colors using CSS: hsl function, linear-gradient, RGB, and hexadecimal. I'm betting there are more but these are a few I was exposed to today! 

**Links**:
https://twitter.com/darlene__rosa/status/1572665817422266368


### Day 12: September 20, 2022

**Progress**:
- Spent over an hour coding today! 
- 100% Finished the "Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu" [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]

**&Thoughts**:
- Having a good day and good time working on these HTML and CSS projects! 

**Links**:
https://twitter.com/darlene__rosa/status/1572298736369537031

### Day 11: September 19, 2022

**Progress**:
- "Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu" [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]

**&Thoughts**:
- Started working on CSS and again, it's like a refresher from the web design course I took in college but I'm actually understanding the concepts more efficiently 

**Links**:
https://twitter.com/darlene__rosa/status/1571954350981009408


### Day 10: September 18, 2022

**Progress**:
- Completed Project 1 "Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App" [Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp]

**&Thoughts**:
- Doing this project was a breeze and fun to build because it was simple but it also felt a little too easy. I did more complex projects in my web design course in college but overall the cat photo app was a good "mini refresher" of basic HTML.
- I'm planning to go through the entire Responsive Web Design course and I'm hoping that it'll actually pay off in helping me become a better coder and get a job in the next few months. I read a few things in a forum that discourage me slightly and I hope freecodecamp is a good route for now. 
- Overall I suppose I should be considering what sort of projects I want to build based on the type of work I think I want to be doing.

### Day 9: September 17, 2022

**Progress**:
- Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp. I'm on Project 1 "Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App" Completed 42/69 steps
- Active on Twitter

**&Thoughts**:
- I was out of the house most of the day and by the time I got home, all I wanted to do was REST. But I am committed to this goal in particular. It is the link that connects my other two personal goals #100daysofmovement and #100daysofbusiness. Without this one, the others will fail because they are ALL personal and EACH is an important investment in my future. This is why I set a minimum 30 minute daily goal. I know my home life can get really busy some days and it's easy to make excuses to not do the work, but if I just do the minimum percentage that will move me an inch, a percent, closer to my goals, I have to do it. Even if I'm exhausted! So I coded for just about 30 minutes today. Coding late at night sucks because I should be sleeping. Ah well. This is it for today.

### Day 8: September 16, 2022

**Progress**:
- Started the Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp. I'm on Project 1 "Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App" Completed 15/69 steps
- Got re-familiarized coding in VScode

**&Thoughts**:
- Definitely feel lighter mentally and spiritually after being doing working on JavaScript. I know it's something I must return to but I've been wanting to shift to working on projects with languages I'm more familiar with. I know I rushed to finish and submit the course and application well before the October deadline but I was starting to feel the same pressures I did when I was in school: Coding to complete it without taking sufficient time to learn it.  Because JavaScript is unfamiliar and complicated for me right now, I am feeling like a failure! I need to experience some fun and small wins to gain some energy before returning to it in a couple of weeks. I learn much better when I am working on a project that builds in complexity over time rather than random exercises to introduce me to concepts. 
- Looking forward to working in HTML while I complete this Cat Photo App. It's the first programming language I ever worked with (back in the days of MySpace! --- I'm aging myself hahaha ). It'll be fun to create something in it again.

### Day 7: September 15, 2022

**Progress**:
- finished the Basic JavaScript course tutorial on freeCodeCamp. 100%
- spent HOURS on the tech training program application and submitted! (I hope my application advances!)

**&Thoughts**:
- The concepts I struggle most with are the 'switch statements', creating 'for' and 'while' loops (same thing I struggled with when learning Python), functions and objects, nested objects and arrays, iterations, arrays, parsing, recursions. Basically all of the fundamental and more complex concepts :(
- This sort of passive learning does not help me solidify the concepts. I really need to be in community to learn and have someone to explain it to me. 
- Although I'll have to revisit this and find other ways to learn JavaScript, I'm happy to be done with this part because I can move on to actually creating projects. Here we go!

### Day 6: Wednesday, September 14, 2022

**Progress**:
- worked for 40 minutes on the JavaScript course tutorial on freeCodeCamp. 83% completed

**&Thoughts**:
- Naturally the freeCodeCamp course will get more challenging as I progress through it. But I'm finding I've had to use hints on most of the problems to complete it. I'm sure every developer has gone through this: the frustrations that come with not being able to figure it out and solve it on your own. I'm not getting too worked up about it because I have faith that in time I'll be able to understand this language. I have no option but to get better. It won't get easier without practice! Plus this is the basis to be able to understand additional frameworks in order to one day build a web application and/or my own mobile application. At minimum, I'd love to play a significant role in a team that is able to build something great. That would be a huge marker of success for me in this tech journey. I've been thinking about that technical training program every day since I received that email. I've received many rejection emails from jobs and other training programs and I don't know if I have many options left to accelerate my learning so I really hope I get accepted into it.

### Day 5: September 13, 2022

**Progress**:
- worked for 37 minutes on the JavaScript course tutorial on freeCodeCamp. 72% completed

**&Thoughts**:
- Some of the exercises on switch statements were confusing. I hope I have more time to code this evening to finish this course.

### Day 4: Monday - September 12, 2022

**Progress**:
- worked for about 60 minutes on the JavaScript course tutorial on freeCodeCamp. 65% completed

**&Thoughts**:
- Nerd moment: feeling good about these neural connections I'm making. Jammed out to YouTube Study Music, Alicia Keys and more R&B while coding.

### Day 3: September 11, 2022

**Progress**:
- worked for about 30 minutes and completed an additional 10% of the Basic JavaScript course on freeCodeCamp
- tweeted about it and engaged with the community

**&Thoughts**:
- Getting exposure on functions and variables. Coding is just like math.
- I decided to knock out some coding practice as my first main activity for the day. Coding in the morning feels better than coding late at night. Definitely feeling tired but starting to think about next steps regarding projects.
- Feeling more hopeful and excited about this self-learning process!

### Day 2: September 10, 2022

**Progress**:
- Found an online timer tab to help me focus while I code
- Completed 30 minutes total of the Basic JavaScript course on freeCodeCamp. 

**&Thoughts**:
- It was truly more reading and comprehension than actual coding, but that's part of the process to re-engage my brain in this way. I took several months off without any coding practice so I'm working my way back into a rhythm. Feeling glad I started this challenge!
- The reason I started with the JavaScript course is because I had already completed about 20% of the course when I logged back in for the first time in months and completing it is a requirement for a software engineering course I want to apply to. I realized I was familiar with this language from my practice with Python and having taken a similar foundational free JavaScript course with FullStackAcademy back around 2017/2018. Hoping to finish it by next week!
- Also want to mention that I am doing #100daysofcoding in tandem with other personal challenges #100daysoffitness and #100daysofbusiness ... and I just learned that these hours spent doing tutorials because I'm learning how to code may not count towards the challenge according to the rules? Either way, I am committing to it until I am able to build projects

### Day 1: September 9, 2022 -  Setting Up

**Goals by the end**:
- Build a portfolio
- Increase skills in HTML, CSS, Python, and Javascript
- Learn a Javascript framework
- Acquire some freelance gigs
- Receive a full-time job offer with my desired salary and benefits

**Thoughts**:  For my personal challenge, I am starting with a 30 minute minimum daily commitment with a goal of 1 hour daily for the next 100 days. Daily consistency is more important than the time put in right now. This is where I've strugged in the past! I'm still learning how to use GitHub and figuring out many other things such as this challenge and which website will be my primary source for learning.  Wish me luck! Let's see how it goes! 

**Progress**:
- Set up a Twitter account https://twitter.com/darlene__rosa.
- Worked on freeCodeCamp's Basic JavaScript course and did a few exercises
