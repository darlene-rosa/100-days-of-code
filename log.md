# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: September 16, 2022

**Progress**:
- Started the Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp. I'm on Project 1 "Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App" Completed 15/69 steps
- Got re-familiarized coding in VScode

**&Thoughts**:
- Definitely feel lighter mentally and spiritually after being doing working on JavaScript. I know it's something I must return to but I've been wanting to shift to working on projects with languages I'm more familiar with. I know I rushed to finish and submit the course and application well before the October deadline but I was starting to feel the same pressures I did when I was in school: Coding to complete it without taking sufficient time to learn it.  Because JavaScript is unfamiliar and complicated for me right now, I am feeling like a failure! I need to experience some fun and small wins to gain some energy before returning to it in a couple of weeks. I learn much better when I am working on a project that builds in complexity over time rather than random exercises to introduce me to concepts. 
- Looking forward to working in HTML while I complete this Cat Photo App. It's the first programming language I ever worked with (back in the days of MySpace! --- I'm aging myself hahaha ). It'll be fun to create something in it again.

### Day 7: September 15, 2022

**Progress**:
- finished the Basic JavaScript course tutorial on freeCodeCamp. 100%
- spent HOURS on the tech training program application and submitted! (I hope my application advances!)

**&Thoughts**:
- The concepts I struggle most with are the 'switch statements', creating 'for' and 'while' loops (same thing I struggled with when learning Python), functions and objects, nested objects and arrays, iterations, arrays, parsing, recursions. Basically all of the fundamental and more complex concepts :(
- This sort of passive learning does not help me solidify the concepts. I really need to be in community to learn and have someone to explain it to me. 
- Although I'll have to revisit this and find other ways to learn JavaScript, I'm happy to be done with this part because I can move on to actually creating projects. Here we go!

### Day 6: Wednesday, September 14, 2022

**Progress**:
- worked for 40 minutes on the JavaScript course tutorial on freeCodeCamp. 83% completed

**&Thoughts**:
- Naturally the freeCodeCamp course will get more challenging as I progress through it. But I'm finding I've had to use hints on most of the problems to complete it. I'm sure every developer has gone through this: the frustrations that come with not being able to figure it out and solve it on your own. I'm not getting too worked up about it because I have faith that in time I'll be able to understand this language. I have no option but to get better. It won't get easier without practice! Plus this is the basis to be able to understand additional frameworks in order to one day build a web application and/or my own mobile application. At minimum, I'd love to play a significant role in a team that is able to build something great. That would be a huge marker of success for me in this tech journey. I've been thinking about that technical training program every day since I received that email. I've received many rejection emails from jobs and other training programs and I don't know if I have many options left to accelerate my learning so I really hope I get accepted into it.

### Day 5: September 13, 2022

**Progress**:
- worked for 37 minutes on the JavaScript course tutorial on freeCodeCamp. 72% completed

**&Thoughts**:
- Some of the exercises on switch statements were confusing. I hope I have more time to code this evening to finish this course.

### Day 4: Monday - September 12, 2022

**Progress**:
- worked for about 60 minutes on the JavaScript course tutorial on freeCodeCamp. 65% completed

**&Thoughts**:
- Nerd moment: feeling good about these neural connections I'm making. Jammed out to YouTube Study Music, Alicia Keys and more R&B while coding.

### Day 3: September 11, 2022

**Progress**:
- worked for about 30 minutes and completed an additional 10% of the Basic JavaScript course on freeCodeCamp
- tweeted about it and engaged with the community

**&Thoughts**:
- Getting exposure on functions and variables. Coding is just like math.
- I decided to knock out some coding practice as my first main activity for the day. Coding in the morning feels better than coding late at night. Definitely feeling tired but starting to think about next steps regarding projects.
- Feeling more hopeful and excited about this self-learning process!

### Day 2: September 10, 2022

**Progress**:
- Found an online timer tab to help me focus while I code
- Completed 30 minutes total of the Basic JavaScript course on freeCodeCamp. 

**&Thoughts**:
- It was truly more reading and comprehension than actual coding, but that's part of the process to re-engage my brain in this way. I took several months off without any coding practice so I'm working my way back into a rhythm. Feeling glad I started this challenge!
- The reason I started with the JavaScript course is because I had already completed about 20% of the course when I logged back in for the first time in months and completing it is a requirement for a software engineering course I want to apply to. I realized I was familiar with this language from my practice with Python and having taken a similar foundational free JavaScript course with FullStackAcademy back around 2017/2018. Hoping to finish it by next week!
- Also want to mention that I am doing #100daysofcoding in tandem with other personal challenges #100daysoffitness and #100daysofbusiness ... and I just learned that these hours spent doing tutorials because I'm learning how to code may not count towards the challenge according to the rules? Either way, I am committing to it until I am able to build projects

### Day 1: September 9, 2022 -  Setting Up

**Goals by the end**:
- Build a portfolio
- Increase skills in HTML, CSS, Python, and Javascript
- Learn a Javascript framework
- Acquire some freelance gigs
- Receive a full-time job offer with my desired salary and benefits

**Thoughts**:  For my personal challenge, I am starting with a 30 minute minimum daily commitment with a goal of 1 hour daily for the next 100 days. Daily consistency is more important than the time put in right now. This is where I've strugged in the past! I'm still learning how to use GitHub and figuring out many other things such as this challenge and which website will be my primary source for learning.  Wish me luck! Let's see how it goes! 

**Progress**:
- Set up a Twitter account https://twitter.com/darlene__rosa.
- Worked on freeCodeCamp's Basic JavaScript course and did a few exercises
